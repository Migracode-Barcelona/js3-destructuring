> ⚠️ **If your assignment has been given to you through GitHub Classroom, this repository *does not need to be forked*: open the created repository using CodeSpaces OR clone the created repository!**

> 💡 Inside a CodeSpace or VS Code, you can also use the shortcut: Control+Alt+N (or ⌃ Control+⌥ Option+N on macOS), or press F1 and then select/type Run Code, the code will run and the output will be shown in the Output window.

### Make sure your code respects the [code style guide](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/code-style-guide) ✍️

> If you are getting an error message when using `git push`, use `git push --force` instead! In general this is bad practice ⛔️ but GitHub Classroom requires it.
